# MCP Studio Lessons Learned

This document captures important lessons learned during development and refactoring of the MCP Studio application.

## Refactoring Lessons

### 2025-05-23: Refactoring renderer.js

#### Issue
When refactoring the monolithic `renderer.js` file into smaller modules, we encountered the following error:

```
utilities.css:1     Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
main.js:73 Failed to initialize MCP Studio: TypeError: serverList.initialize is not a function
    at HTMLDocument.initializeApp (main.js:39:16)
```

#### Root Cause
The error occurred because we created a new module `js/ui/server-list.js` that exported a class `ServerList` instead of a singleton instance with an `initialize` method. This didn't match the pattern used by other modules in the project, which were singleton instances with `initialize` methods.

The main application code in `js/main.js` was expecting to call `serverList.initialize()`, but our implementation didn't provide this method on the exported object.

#### Solution
We updated our approach to match the project's established patterns:

1. Modified `js/ui/server-list.js` to export a singleton instance instead of a class:
   ```javascript
   // Create and export a singleton instance
   const serverList = new ServerList();
   export default serverList;
   ```

2. Added an `initialize()` method to the `ServerList` class:
   ```javascript
   initialize() {
     this.serverListElement = document.getElementById('server-list');
     return this;
   }
   ```

3. Updated `js/ui/modal-handlers.js` to follow the same pattern.

4. Updated imports in `renderer.js` to use the singleton instances:
   ```javascript
   import serverList from './ui/server-list.js';
   import serverForm from './ui/server-form/index.js';
   import modalHandlers from './ui/modal-handlers.js';
   ```

#### Lesson Learned
When refactoring code in an existing project:

1. **Understand the project patterns**: Before making changes, analyze how the existing code is structured and follow those patterns consistently.

2. **Check dependencies**: Understand how different parts of the application interact with each other. In this case, `js/main.js` expected a specific interface from the `serverList` module.

3. **Incremental changes**: Make small, focused changes and test frequently to catch issues early.

4. **Consistent module structure**: Maintain consistency in how modules are structured and exported. In this project, modules are exported as singleton instances with an `initialize` method.
