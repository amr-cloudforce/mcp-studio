PROBLEM: 
compsio stil lnot is see this badget in the server list  

Window: MCP Studio
Page: Main Application
Element: span.source-badge.composio-badge
ID: none
Classes: source-badge composio-badge
Selector: span.source-badge.composio-badge
Text: ðŸ”— Composio
Parent: div


but in the comnpsio list when is elect instaleld only i see this

No installed Composio apps found


TRIALS SO FAR: 

THIS APPROACH DID NOT WORK.
I can see the issue! The Composio filter is working (Apify now works), but there's a mismatch between:

1. __Server list shows__: `ðŸ”— Composio` badge (indicating Composio servers exist)
2. __Composio marketplace shows__: "No installed Composio apps found" when "Installed only" is checked

This means the `getInstalledComposioServers()` function in the Composio connector is not correctly identifying installed Composio servers.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem is in the `getInstalledComposioServers()` function in `js/features/composio-marketplace/composio-connector.js`. It's looking for servers with:

```javascript
server.composio && server.composio.source === 'composio' && server.composio.appKey
```

But the actual server configuration might have different metadata structure or the `appKey` field might be named differently.

## Investigation Plan

I need to:

1. __Check the actual server configuration structure__ - see how Composio servers are stored in the config
2. __Compare with the detection logic__ - verify what fields the `getInstalledComposioServers()` function is looking for
3. __Fix the mismatch__ - update the detection logic to match the actual server structure

## Verification Method

Add console logs to see:

```javascript
// In getInstalledComposioServers():
console.log('[DEBUG] All servers in config:', Object.entries(config.mcpServers));
console.log('[DEBUG] Composio servers found:', composioServers);
```

The issue is that the server detection logic doesn't match how Composio servers are actually stored in the configuration.

Would you like me to toggle to

Act Mode (âŒ˜â‡§A) to investigate and fix this mismatch?

YOU WILL FUCKEN FIND OUT BY FUCNE CHREADIN GHTE CODE AND FINDING THE CAUSE AND DONT UCKN ASK ME FOR ACT BEFORE YOUF UCKEN HAVE FOUDN THE REAL CAUSE. FAILINYG OT BE HONST FINDING THE REAL PORBOLEM I WILL FUCKEN FIRE YOU. AND YOU FUCKNE TELL ME HOW TO VERIFY THE FUCEKN ASSUMPTION YOU DO E,G. BY CONSOLE LOGS EPXECTED OR WHATEVER

Found the exact issue! There's a __data structure mismatch__ between how the server list detects Composio servers vs how the marketplace filter detects them:

## Root Cause Analysis

__Server List Detection__ (in `js/features/server-list-enhancements/ui/table.js`):

```javascript
if (server.config.composio && server.config.composio.source === 'composio') {
  return '<span class="source-badge composio-badge">ðŸ”— Composio</span>';
}
```

- Looks for: `server.config.composio.source === 'composio'`

__Marketplace Filter Detection__ (in `js/features/composio-marketplace/composio-connector.js`):

```javascript
return Object.values(config.mcpServers).some(server => 
  server.composio && server.composio.source === 'composio' && server.composio.appKey === appKey
);
```

- Looks for: `server.composio.source === 'composio'`

## The Problem

The server list checks `server.config.composio` but the marketplace filter checks `server.composio` (missing `.config`).

## Verification Method

Add these console logs to confirm:

__In `getInstalledComposioServers()`:__

```javascript
console.log('[DEBUG] All servers:', Object.entries(config.mcpServers));
console.log('[DEBUG] Checking server structures:');
Object.values(config.mcpServers).forEach(server => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] Server:', server);
  console.log('[DEBUG] Has server.composio:', !!server.composio);
  console.log('[DEBUG] Has server.config.
```
